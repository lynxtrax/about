# Hi, I'm Lynx (18, it/he/she)! 
- I'm very much new to coding besides surface-level topics. I'm intermediate when it comes to HTML and CSS but am trying to learn about using the terminal and git.
- Besides that, I'm looking into JS to learn a new language and go deeper into front-end webdev.
- You can email me at webmeowster@fantasiz.ing or add me on Discord @lynxtrax.
